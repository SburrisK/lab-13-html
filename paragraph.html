			It's going down...once again it is! Composed sentenses, all together venomous.The four elements of a natural force, projected daily through the sound of the source. Everybody on the board as we blend, the sword with the pen, the mightiest the weapons swinging right from the chin to elevate of mental states long gone with the wind

			It starts with one... one thing, I don't know why, it doesn't even matter how hard you try, keep that in my I designed this rhyme to  explain in due time. Time is a valuble thing, watch it fly by as the pendulum swings watch it count down to the end of the day, the clock ticks life away. Diddn't look out the low, watch the time go right out the window. Trying to hold on but didn't even know I wasted my time just to watch you goooooooo!
